## ‚ùì What Is It?

**GhostGrab** is a CLI utility written in PowerShell 7+ that automates the video download process using `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`. It avoids browser-based bottlenecks and handles everything natively via terminal ‚Äî ideal for clean, fast, and repeatable downloads.

It also supports:
- Cookie-based authentication
- Filename customization and sanitization
- Custom output directories
- Pre-flight checks for dependencies and system compatibility
- (Experimental) Optional log configuration ‚Äî selection prompt exists, but logs are not yet functional

<br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works?

1. Verifies PowerShell 7+ is being used.
2. Checks for required tools (`yt-dlp.exe` and `ffmpeg.exe`).
3. Asks for the video URL and validates it.
4. Prompts for log preference (not yet functional).
5. Checks if authentication is needed (via domain cookies).
6. Retrieves the video title and allows filename override.
7. Asks for the output folder (default is `downloads/`).
8. Attempts download ‚Äî using cookies if needed.
9. Verifies success, logs if enabled, and cleans up.

> Everything happens via terminal prompts ‚Äî lightweight and interactive.

<br>

## üì¶ Installation

There‚Äôs no installer. Just extract and run.

1. Download the latest `.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Nespre/ghostgrab/releases) page.
2. Extract the archive.
3. Double-click `downloader.exe` or launch `downloader.ps1` in PowerShell 7+.

All dependencies (yt-dlp, ffmpeg, folder structure, etc.) come bundled.

<br>

## üöÄ Usage

Once launched, you'll be guided via terminal prompts:
1. Paste the video URL.
2. Choose whether to enable logging.
3. If required, provide cookie file (placed in the /cookies folder).
4. Customize the output filename and directory if desired.
5. Let GhostGrab do the rest.

> Tip: Cookie files should be named like cookies_tiktok.com.txt, cookies_youtube.com.txt, etc.
